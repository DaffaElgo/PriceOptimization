<h2 align="center"> <b>Price Optimization</b> </h2>

AIM

- Provided with Restaurant Cafe data , we are able to leverage price elasticity with historical Cafe sales data to measure customers' responsiveness towards quantity demanded or supply due to price changes and find the optimal price to set for their items for maximum profit i.e striking a balance in less price or high price for optimal profit.

METHODOLOGY

- <b> Exploratory data analysis </b>

  - Any covariate with like SchoolBreak, Weekends that increases sales and has no effects on price are dropped since we are not interested in seeing effects on sales due to these covariates.
  - Check for missing values.
  - Uncovering multiple facets of merge data.

- ## <b> Modelling </b>
